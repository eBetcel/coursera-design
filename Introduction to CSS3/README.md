2) Style the following:

The body should have padding and margin

The header should have a background color, background image (using a local image), and padding

The navigation links (and only the links in the navigation) should be styled with a new display, margin, border-radius, text-decoration, and padding

The link to the current page should be styled differently from the other links (using class = "active')

The sections should be next to each other, not one on top of the other.

The images should be part of the page now. In addition, they should have a border, be centered horizontally, and have vertical (top/bottom) space between them and the other images.
